description: Embarking on my tech journey at the age of 16 with my first line of C code—without having access to mobile phone or computer prior—I’ve traversed an extraordinary path over the past 11 years. Today, I leverage advanced machine learning technologies, training sophisticated transformer networks on GPUs. This voyage from my initial curiosity in programming to the forefront of artificial intelligence reflects my adaptability and passion for continuous learning in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

With a solid foundation in programming, starting with competitive programming in C and building websites using Java servlet for Hackathons while in college, I have ventured into an expert Data Scientist with my expertise in Python, Machine Learning, Neural Network , Forecasting, NLP, Deployment , SQL & Data Visualization. In this realm, I specialize in crafting models with PyTorch and TensorFlow.

My engagement in data science hackathons on platforms like Kaggle, MachineHack, AppliedAI  sharpened my problem-solving abilities, competitive spirit, and creative approach to complex challenges. This competitive advantage enhances my technical proficiency, presenting me as a comprehensive candidate for forefront tech positions.

Leveraging my background in cutting-edge technologies, I aim to empower teams, bolster technological capabilities, and drive the creation of transformative solutions that propel companies forward. My commitment to collaboration, continuous learning, and pushing the boundaries of possibility equips me to make a substantial impact in my forthcoming roles.
